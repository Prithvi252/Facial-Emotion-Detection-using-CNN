# Facial-Emotion-Detection-using-CNN
This is a facial emotion detection system implemented using ML concepts like CNN and ResNet50. It also has a GUI with face tracking algorithms to accurately predict the emotion of the user.

Facial emotion recognition (FER) is an important topic in the fields of computer vision and artificial intelligence owing to its significant academic and commercial potential. This project aims to build a meaningful Machine Learning model that can classify a given image into a fixed range of emotions such as neutral, angry, happy, sad, etc. The Machine Learning algorithm that'll be used here is Convolutional Neural Network or CNN for short. It mimics the human brain (neurons to be specific) and has multiple layers from input to output that can learn different aspects of a given input. The goal is to maximize the accuracy achieved at the end of training. Such a model can be used for various real-life problems such as assisting blind people during social interactions, during therapy sessions, etc.

This documentation gives a brief about the project and our work on it. This report also assumes that you’re familiar with the fundamentals of CNN, perceptron/artificial neurons.
Using Added data, and ResNet we were able to get 76%+ accuracy which was 105 more than the research paper result.
